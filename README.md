# CSS Lab

A place where I experiment with CSS and create things.

Practice section are exercises from Emil's [animation](https://animations.dev/) course. It's phenomenal. You should do it. ðŸ’™

My own creations have a different section. I want to keep them separated in order to give Emil proper credit but to be transparent too. ðŸ™Œ
